# Fake Data, Real Results
### Using Synthetic Data When You Can't Use the Real Thing

## Learning Objectives
After my presentation, if you were not too hyped up on caffeine and conference jitters, you should be able to...
- Articulate the difference between synthetic data and dummy data
- Recognize the situations where dummy data might suffice versus ones requiring more realistic and complex datasets
- Understand how synthetic data can be used internally for modeling and analytics to limit access to real, raw data
- Prove mathematically how synthetic data performs statistically similar to real data for analytics

## ELI5 Version
- Stop giving people you work with the real, super private data when they do not really need it.
- They do not need it because you can give them synthetic data that does a lot of the same things.
- Synthetic data is a lot better at pretending to be real data than if you tried to make it up all by yourself.
- If a bad guy gets the synthetic data, it is not as bad as a bad guy getting the real data.
- Don't believe me? That's okay. We will prove it with math. To adventure!

## Presentation Outline
_(to refresh your memory, or if you were not there and found this repo by accident)_
- Discussion on the differences between synthetic data and dummy data.
- Case studies and real-world implications for the banking industry.
- Analysis of synthetic data performance in descriptive and predictive analytics.
- Code examples for generating and analyzing synthetic data.

## Installation Instructions
Users can access my GitHub library and see all of the code in Posit Connect. They can run that code locally or in their browsers using platforms like Deepnote. Users can upload all of my `.ipynb` files to Deepnote to run the code themselves. They will need to change the `FILEPATH` placeholders and some other variables to point to the real data CSVs and directories.
